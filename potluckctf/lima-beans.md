It was just yesterday when I was making my favorite dish (lima beans with lemon and lime) that I realised I could turn my favorite dish (lima beans with lemon and lime) into a unpenetrable cryptosystem 32 times stronger than AES.
I, of course immediately patented the cryptosystem so that other people could not steal my idea.
I will let you try out my cryptosystem, but you will only be allowed to encrypt data, not decrypt it, so that you can\'t steal my cryptosystem.
If you find any vulnerability with the cryptosystem then please send me proof by decrypting the flag.
In the words of my grandfather (Albert Einstein)
""Man I love lima beans with lemon and lime, also PoC || GTFO""
